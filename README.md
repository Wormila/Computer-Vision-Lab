# Computer-Vision-Lab
The experiments focus on core computer vision operations such as image acquisition, transformations, histogram processing, edge and feature detection, enhancement, filtering, texture segmentation, image segmentation, and object detection. All tasks are implemented using OpenCV to gain practical understanding of vision algorithms.
